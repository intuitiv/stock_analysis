Pouring postgresql@17--17.4_1.arm64_sequoia.bottle.tar.gz
==> /opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@17/17.4_1/bin/initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@17
==> Caveats
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@17

When uninstalling, some dead symlinks are left behind so you may want to run:
  brew cleanup --prune-prefix

postgresql@17 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have postgresql@17 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find postgresql@17 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/include"

To start postgresql@17 now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql@17
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  LC_ALL="C" /opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@17/bin/postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@17
